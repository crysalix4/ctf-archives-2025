# Solution to CodeCage Challenge
**Category**: Web Exploitation  
**Flag**: `VSL{all0w_3sc4p3_1s_fun_hehe_00e0dcbd5!}`

## Description

This is a place for you to test your coding skills and explore interesting things in a safe environment. Don't forget to solve the CAPTCHA to get started, and remember that all your actions must comply with security principles.

## Code
```python
ALLOWED_MODULES = {
    'abc',
    'aifc',
    'argparse',
    'array',
    'ast',
    'audioop',
    'base64',
    'calendar',
    'cmath',
    'code',
    'codecs',
    'copy',
    'random
    ...
}
```
## Solution

### 1. Analyzing the `random` Module
Upon inspecting the `random` module, it becomes evident that it has a linkage to the `_os` module. This association presents an opportunity to exploit and execute Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the sandbox environment.

### 2. Exploiting with Reverse Shells
We use reverse shells (`revshells`) to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the `flag.txt` file.

### Key Insight
This challenge can also be solved by directly reading the `flag.txt` file. The primary reason is that the author made a custom implementation error. ðŸ˜…
